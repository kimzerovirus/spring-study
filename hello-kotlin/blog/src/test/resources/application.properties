#Sometimes you need to execute a method before or after all tests of a given class.
# Like Junit 4, JUnit 5 requires by default these methods to be static (which translates to companion object in Kotlin, which is quite verbose and not straightforward)
# because test classes are instantiated one time per test.

# Junit 5 allows you to change this default behavior
